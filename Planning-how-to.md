## Checklist

There are a number of things to take into account before planning to ensure the success of the sprint. These are:

- [ ] Check the workload of all team members in other projects by checking their Trello boards. We might be busier than we think.
- [ ] Beware of holidays, days off, appointments, events etc. by checking the calendar beforehand. It happens sometimes that a team member leaves early on a Friday afternoon and the retro needs to be rescheduled.
- [ ] Watch out for big events and deadlines ahead in the calendar such as FESC. It's good to have some room and prepare things in-time. Some tasks may won't be finished in a single sprint.

## Conventions

### Epics

Make sure big tasks have a matching Epic Trello card (labeled as such) and concrete and isolated cards are attached to them. We do so by pasting the link of the concrete task into the Epic's checklist. Then we mark them as complete as these children cards move along the board until "Done". This brings better visibility of the progress throughout the sprint.

### Extras

Think twice when adding an extra task in the middle of the sprint. We tend to agree on adding those that are small and involve answering a customer, partner, etc. those that are related to the infrastructure and can't wait until next sprint. In that case, add the "Extra" label and track them with that same tag in Toggl. It comes without saying that ideally we should not have any of these, but life is hard. However, please do not go astray.

### Calendar events

When adding events on the calendar, such as workshops, make sure you also count the shifting in it. This is especially relevant for those that happen elsewhere in Catalunya. These easilly take up half a day and affect the time left for other tasks.

### Retro notes

Someone needs to be in charge of writting them down after the retro and sharing them in a Trello card with the rest of the team. To that end, a card should be created to account for it in each sprint.
