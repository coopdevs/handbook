When a new repo is created, we need to remember to add all members we want to the Coopdevs "Contributors" team with "write" permissions, if needed. All "contributors" can check [here](https://github.com/orgs/coopdevs/teams/contributors/repositories) which coopdevs repos they have access to. All "contributors" can create a Pull Request using the fork firsth by forking the repo. You can check the Atlassion handbook on this [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

## gitlab.com/coopdevs

It's more straightforward than in Github. Organization named "Coopdevs" is already a [user group with members](https://gitlab.com/groups/coopdevs/-/group_members). So all repos created inside this "group", are already shared to all group members.
