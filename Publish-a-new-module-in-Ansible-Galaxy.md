To publish a new Ansible role in a [Ansible Galaxy]() we need to replicate the next steps:

1. Create a release in the repository that you want to publish.

2. Login in Ansible Galaxy with your GitHub account.

3. Inside `My Content` click in `+Add Content` of the Organization and select the project you want to publish.

TODO: Update the Galaxy content when you create a new release.
