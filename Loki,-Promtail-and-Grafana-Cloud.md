We hired Grafana Cloud services. This provides us:
* Visualisation:  [Grafana instance](https://coopdevs.grafana.net/)
* Metrics: [Prometheus data storage](https://grafana.com/products/cloud#prometheus-details)
* Logs: [Loki server](https://grafana.com/oss/loki#about)
* [Customer support](https://grafana.com/contact)

This doesn't provide us:
* Metrics: [Prometheus server](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)  
  See [Ansible playbook to provision a Prometheus instance](https://gitlab.com/coopdevs/monitor-provisioning/)  
  middle-person role: remote-read _from many hosts_ â†’ remote-write _to single prometheus db_
* Logs: [Promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/docs/promtail.md), logs collector agent
* Mixed logs/metrics dashboards: ~~currently Loki can only be visualized through Grafana explore~~. Since v6.4 [logs can be visualized from Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/features/panels/logs/).
