When a new repo is created, we need to remember to add all members we want to the Coopdevs "Contributors" team with "write" permissions, if needed. All "contributors" can check [here](https://github.com/orgs/coopdevs/teams/contributors/repositories) which coopdevs repos they have access to. All "contributors" can create a Pull Request using the fork firsth by forking the repo. You can check the Atlassion handbook on this forking workflow  [](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
